# IMPORTANT!

The Slack username is not necessarily the same as the Display Name. If
configuring this returner to post as a regular user, then you can visit
`https://workspace.slack.com/account/settings#username` (with `workspace`
replaced with yours) and scroll to the bottom of the page to see your Slack
username. However, it is a good idea to create a bot user.

Click [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) to
request an API key for a regular user.

Visit `https://workspace.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations` (with
`workspace` replaced with yours), and then click `Bots` to get to the page
where you can request a bot user.

Requesting either a bot user or an API key requires approval from a Workspace
Admin.
