# Minion Configuration

This config file does two things:

1. Sets the IP of the Master
2. Tells the minion to run all of the states configured in the [top
   file](https://github.com/terminalmage/talks/blob/master/2018-07-chipy/master/srv/salt/top.sls)
   when the Minion starts up and establishes a connection to the Master.
